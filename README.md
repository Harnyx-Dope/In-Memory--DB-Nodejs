Description
This project implements a micro-service to derive simplified summary statistics (mean, min, max) on a dataset. It provides APIs to add records, delete records, and fetch summary statistics for salary based on various criteria.
Installation

    Access the APIs using the following endpoints:

Endpoints

    GET /summaryStatistics/all: Fetch summary statistics for salary over the entire dataset.
    GET /summaryStatistics/onContract: Fetch summary statistics for salary for records which satisfy "on_contract": "true".
    GET /summaryStatistics/department: Fetch summary statistics for salary for each department.
    GET /summaryStatistics/departmentSubDepartment: Fetch summary statistics for salary for each department and sub-department combination.

Authentication

    The /addRecord and /deleteRecord endpoints are protected with JWT authentication.
    To generate a JWT token, make a POST request to /getAccess with the username and password in the request body.
